Describe your specifications in the form and let our intelligent real time algorithm
to offer you an accurate budget estimation.

## Seriously

This is just a joke, we are trying to explain that any fixed estimation
is gonna be just a guess.

For all these people that ask for a **fixed budget** in a
software application development, just let them know that
any estimation is just a guess normally as random as the
algorithm used above.

In defense of the [incremental development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development).
